" Here are the names of the plugins
" To get them: download each plugin (you can find each one on github and unzip them like this:
" First: download
" Second: create a folder in your home directory
" .vim/pack/plugins/start
" and place these unzipped plugins in the start directory
" 
" You can also use the script I placed in this repo, after having first downloaded the plugins
